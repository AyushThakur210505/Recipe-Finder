    <h2>METHOD</h2>
    <h2>Preparation of Kidney Beans (Rajma):</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Rinse the kidney beans thoroughly under running water.</li>
      <li>Soak the kidney beans in enough water overnight or for at least 8 hours. This helps in reducing the cooking time and makes the beans softer.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>COOKING KIDNEY BEANS:</h2>
      <ol>
      <li>After soaking, drain the water from the kidney beans and rinse them again.</li>
      <li>Transfer the kidney beans to a pressure cooker or a large pot.</li>
      <li>Add enough water to cover the kidney beans by about 2 inches.</li>
      <li>Pressure cook the kidney beans until they are soft and fully cooked. This usually takes about 15-20 minutes on medium heat. If you're using a pot, it might take longer, around 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Once cooked, set aside.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>MAKING RAJMA:</h2>
      <ol>
      <li>Heat oil or ghee in a pan over medium heat.</li>
      <li>Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
      <li>Add chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brow</li>
      <li>Add minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
      <li>Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they turn mushy and oil starts to separate.</li>
      <li>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a minute.</li>
      <li>Add the cooked kidney beans along with any remaining water from cooking. If needed, add more water to adjust the consistency of the curry.</li>
      <li>Simmer the curry for about 10-15 minutes on low heat, stirring occasionally, until the flavors are well blended.
        <li>Finally, add garam masala and mix well. Cook for another 2-3 minute</li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>SERVING</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Serve hot Rajma with steamed rice or roti (Indian flatbread) garnished with more fresh coriander leaves if desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious Rajma!</li>

      <h2>EXPERT TIPS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Be sure to soak your dried beans! It is important to soak the rajma (kidney beans) overnight or for 8 to 9 hours and then cook them really well. Dried beans when soaked become more easy to digest as soaking reduces the phytic acid in them. The phytates present in beans cause indigestion and flatulence. Soaking also helps the beans to cook faster.</li><br>
        <li>Cook your rajma well! While making recipe with kidney beans, they have to be cooked really well. They should melt in your mouth when you bite into them offering no resistance. This is a very crucial and the most overlooked aspect of cooking rajma. Even in restaurants, the beans have a bite in them and this not only ruins the texture in the dish but also affects your stomach.</li><br>
        <li>Vegan variation: Instead of butter, use oil and skip the cream completely. Alternately, you can opt to use a vegan butter and coconut cream if you prefer a richer curry. The flavors of coconut will be felt in vegan rajma recipe but it will taste good.</li>
