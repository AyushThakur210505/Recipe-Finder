    Oven-baked chicken is a timeless dish that combines simplicity with delicious flavor. Seasoned with olive oil, salt, pepper, and optional herbs or spices, the chicken is roasted in a preheated oven until golden brown and crispy on the outside, while remaining juicy and tender inside.  </p></div>

    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken pieces (such as thighs, drumsticks, breasts, or a whole chicken)</li>
      <li>Olive oil or melted butter</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper</li>
      <li>Optional seasonings (such as garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, dried herbs like thyme or rosemary)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
<div class="ironman">
    <h2>METHOD</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C) for bone-in chicken pieces or 375°F (190°C) for boneless chicken breasts.</li>
      <li>Prepare the Chicken: Rinse the chicken pieces under cold water and pat them dry with paper towels. This helps to ensure crispy skin.</li>
      <li>Season the Chicken: Place the chicken pieces in a large bowl and drizzle them with olive oil or melted butter. Season generously with salt, pepper, and any additional seasonings or herbs you like. Toss the chicken to coat evenly.</li>
      <li>Arrange the Chicken in a Baking Dish: Place the seasoned chicken pieces in a single layer in a baking dish or on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or aluminum foil. If you're cooking a whole chicken, you can truss it (tie the legs together) for more even cooking.</li>
      <li>Bake the Chicken: Put the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake until the chicken is cooked through and the skin is crispy and golden brown. Cooking times will vary depending on the size and type of chicken pieces. Bone-in chicken pieces typically take about 35-45 minutes, while boneless, skinless chicken breasts may only take 20-25 minutes. If you're cooking a whole chicken, it will take longer, about 20 minutes per pound (450g).</li>
      <li>Check for Doneness: The best way to ensure that the chicken is fully cooked is to use a meat thermometer. Insert the thermometer into the thickest part of the chicken (without touching bone if applicable). The internal temperature should register at least 165°F (75°C) for all poultry.</li>
      <li>Rest and Serve: Once the chicken is done, remove it from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before serving. This allows the juices to redistribute, resulting in juicier meat.</li>
      </ol>

        <h2>VARIATIONS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Lemon Herb Chicken: Add fresh lemon juice, lemon zest, and chopped herbs like parsley, thyme, and rosemary to the olive oil or butter mixture.</li>
          <li>Spicy Chicken: Season the chicken with a blend of chili powder, cayenne pepper, and smoked paprika for a kick of heat.</li>
          <li>Honey Mustard Chicken: Brush the chicken with a mixture of honey, Dijon mustard, and a splash of apple cider vinegar before baking.</li>
          <li>BBQ Chicken: Brush the chicken with your favorite barbecue sauce before baking for a tangy and sweet flavor.</li>
